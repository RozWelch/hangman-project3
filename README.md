## How to play

Hangcow follows the same rules as Hangman. A user will select a level easy, medium or difficult. A random word is selected, and '_' shown for each letter in the word. A user guesses a letter. The input is checked to see if it is an alphabetic, single letter. If not they are asked to input a letter again. If the letter is in the word, the correct letter is shown in its position in the word. If the letter is not in the word they loose a life. The user continues to guess until they run out of lives without completing the work, when a 'You loose' message is displayed; or they correctly guess the word, when a 'You win" message is displayed.
